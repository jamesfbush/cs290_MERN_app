# cs290_MERN_app
A full-stack MERN app for CS290 Web Development at Oregon State in Fall 2021.

## The app 
Using a MERN stack, we were tasked to write a Single Page Application (SPA) that tracks exercises completed by the user. App uses React for the front-end UI and has  a REST API using Node and Express for the back-end web service. A MongoDB instance is used for database persistence.

## Installation 
Using Node Package Manager, run `npm install` within the root directory of the app. This will install all needed dependencies. 

## Running the app 
Within the react subfolder, run `npm start` and the app will launch within the default browser window.
